The module enable auto call recording for __Sony Xperiaâ„¢__ devices with __stock firmware__.

The module __only__ works on device which has `call recording feature`.
On older firmwares, the feature is `builtin`.
On Lollipop, Sony split it into the app called `CallRecording(com.sonymobile.callrecording)`.

So if your firmware is Lollipop, You __must__ install CallRecording.
You can find it at [here][callrecorder_addr1] ~~or the [flashable file][callrecorder_addr2] for 5.1.1~~
